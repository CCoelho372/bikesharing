## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to show investors how a bike sharing program in Des Moines could be successful based off of data from a successful bike share program, CitiBike, in New York City.

###### Figure 1: Checkout Times for Users

The overwhelming majority of checkout times were for on average 10 minutes. After 10 minutes there is a significant drop.

###### Figure 2: Checkout Times by Gender

Males were the most likely to take the bikes out and also more likely to use the bikes than females. Females were about a third as likely to take the bikes out but followed a similar pattern in how long they used the bikes for.

###### Figure 5: Trips by Gender by Weekday

Males are most likely to be a subscriber to the bike sharing program. Females look as if they are only using the bike sharing if they are a subscriber. There is little color change for a female customer.

###### Figure 6: Average Trip Duration

As people get younger they are more likely to have a longer trip duration. Birth years over a 100 should not be available as that causes lost data points and is not beneficial to analysis.

###### Figure 7: Top Starting Location

Top starting locations were in lower manhattan suggesting that many people are using it to get to work. It is also areas where there are more tourist destinations.

## Summary 

In summary of this analysis an how it relates to Des Moines the key areas to focus on in establishing the business model would be to target Males who will subscribe to the bikes to get to where they need to be in under 10 minutes. The secondary market is Females with that same intention getting to work within 10 minutes. Although the idea came from a vacation in NYC, it looks as if most people using the bikes are not tourists, but instead are people getting to work. That would be a consideration for Des Moines. Are there enough people within 10 minutes from work that would want to take a bike instead of their car to get to work? In New York City the cost of a parking spot and the amount of traffic are incentivizing people to use bikes.

To better address this it may be helpful to remove those riders that are subscribers and see the demographics and usage in New York City. It would also then be good to determine the amount of tourists that go to Des Moines and see if there is enough of a market to have visitors use a bike share. It looks as if it would be difficult to set up the same business plan as New York City with the bike sharing considering most of the users are commuters.
